         "comments":"We had a wonderful time staying at the silo cottage! Even though the cottage is located off the beaten path, the directions that were provided were very clear and helpful. Denise and her husband were very kind and accommodating. When we arrived Denise"s husband was there to guide us to the cottage and later was even so kind to give us a tour of the larger silo. The first night my boyfriend and I stayed at the cottage we unfortunately lost the keys and had to call her husband late at night. But Denise"s husband was very understanding and gave us a spare key with no extra charge. Additionally he checked in to make sure we were comfortable and had enough wood pellets for the stove. The inside of the cottage is clean and cozy, it was very enjoyable to sit inside reading a book by the warm pellet stove. Overall we had an amazing time staying at the silo cottage and would definitely stay there again!",
